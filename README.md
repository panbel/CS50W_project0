# CS50W_project0
My first project with github

This is a website for my dad. It is in Greek.
It contains a home page with some basic information about him, an about page, a page where people can download and read his articles, a page about his beliefs and a contact page. All the webpages are available in the "templates" folder. 

In the contact page, people can put in their email address which is then saved in a database (database.db). This way they can receive emails with updates. 

The application.py file has the code to create the webpage and it is using flask. 

In the "static" folder, there is a file called style.scss which contains all the styling that is used. It was converted to a css file because scss is not recognized. The folder "articles" contains some of the articles that my dad wrote. They can be downloaded from the webpage by clicking on some specific buttons. The folder "photos_billy" contains photos which were used as background images.
